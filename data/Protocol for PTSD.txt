Inclusion Criteria:
Articles selected for the final review must meet the following criteria: (a) they must be longitudinal studies with at least three measurement waves assessing PTSD, (b) the PTSD measurements should be on a continuous scale, collected through either an interview or a questionnaire, (c) the studies should utilize one of the following clustering methods: latent growth, latent factors, cluster analysis, latent class analysis, latent growth mixture modeling, mixed linear models, latent profile, mixture, typologies, profile, or discriminant analysis, and (d) the traumatic stress symptoms must follow events that satisfy the DSM-IV criterion A1 for PTSD or acute stress disorder. Relevant studies should use topic terms such as traumatic stress, stress disorder, posttraumatic stress, or PTSD.
Exclusion Criteria:
Studies will be excluded if they do not meet the inclusion criteria mentioned above. Specifically, articles will be excluded if they are cross-sectional studies, neurobiological studies, or studies from unrelated fields (e.g., medical procedures following physical trauma). Furthermore, exact duplicates and studies that do not directly apply one of the specified cluster techniques within the trauma context will also be excluded. Any study failing to provide a clear methodology or sufficient data to meet the inclusion standards will be excluded from the final review.

 Only studies that performed viral metagenomic sequencing in specimens from farm animals were included.

Inclusion Criteria for Abstract and Title Screening:
Study Type:

The study must be original research that involves viral metagenomic sequencing.
Excludes conference abstracts, reviews, editorials, and commentaries.
Language:

The study must be published in English.
Animal Focus:

The study must involve common livestock, specifically cattle, small ruminants (goats and sheep), poultry, and pigs.
Methodology:

The study must use metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) to analyze viral diversity.
Data Reporting:

The study must report original data related to viral metagenomics in farm animals.
Specimen Type:

The study should include samples taken from farm animals.
Exclusion Criteria for Abstract and Title Screening:
Non-English Studies:

Any study not published in English.
Non-Original Research:

Review articles, editorials, commentaries, and conference abstracts.
Irrelevant Species:

Studies that do not focus on the specified livestock (cattle, small ruminants, poultry, and pigs).
Non-Metagenomic Methods:

Studies that do not use mNGS for viral detection.
Lack of Data:

Studies that do not present original data on viral metagenomics in farm animals.
